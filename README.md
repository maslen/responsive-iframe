responsive-iframe
=================

This is a demo to show you how to use JavaScript to make an iframe appear "seemless".  I call this the "responsive-iframe" because iFrames are typically static and so don't play well with responsive web design.  This code manages the height and width of the iframe so the user is never aware that there is a 2nd document in the page.

 * The Guardian open sourced their [own version of this technique](https://github.com/guardian/iframe-messenger)
 * David Bradshaw keeps maintains a [decent version too](https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer)
